# Tilt-Switch

ECE 387 Project

This device is a TM1000 E series tilt switch.

Check the Wiki page for the tutorial example video, datasheet, and report.

--Note--

I was unable to get the arduino code running in C and compile using avr-gcc. I figured that an arduino file was better than nothing on the code side of things.
